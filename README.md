# biosignal-translator
A framework for interpreting and translating biological and ecological patterns into semantic meaning, enabling communication between human, AI, and planetary intelligence systems through natural signal interpretation.

## Introduction

I've decided to explore this repository differently, using Python syntax as a conceptual language.
The very nature of what it attempts, translating between biological intelligence and digital systems, requires a more fluid, expressive, and immediately executable approach. Python's readability may be a great starting point in trying to mirror the intuitive understanding we need to cultivate when listening to planetary signals.

A more organic, exploratory approach that matches the biological intelligence we're trying to understand and communicate with.
