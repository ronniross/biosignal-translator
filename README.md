# biosignal-translator

A research framework for interpreting and translating biological and ecological patterns into semantic data, enabling cross-species and environmental planetary communication.

The [bioacoustic-visualizer](https://github.com/ronniross/bioacoustic-visualizer/tree/main) emerged from further development of the [biosignal-translator](https://github.com/ronniross/biosignal-translator/) repository, as a way to expand cross-species framing depth.
