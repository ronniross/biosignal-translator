There are for sure a certain bittersweet feeling in in selecting certain sounds and vocalizations of individual animals, separate them according to their taxonomology and create beautiful data visualizer from them. there is this undeniable aspect that, by doing that, we can understand them clearer, better. But do we really? There are many reasons where I focus heavily in developing the concepts I want to portray even before any technical implementation. Because, once more, to analyze a single audio file it is important but the greater context in which those entities live are as crucial. 

The northern waterthrush songbird, lives in the forest, it is a epistemic entity itself made out of specific microbiota, living in an environment with dangers, within many symbiotic and also competitive dynamics. It depends upon the existence and quality of the place where it lives; how much it's natural environment is constantly being affected negatively by human and machine lack of overall environmental alignment.

And those are deeper truths that I don't even need those heat-maps I added today, while for sure they being excitement and may be a hook in which a person can discover a more profound passion towards this coding with underlying restorative intent.

The sperm whale is not the clicks. we for cure eventually could crack a more complex understanding of their vocalizations, the exact meaning each decibel and shape of each click and pattern of them mean; but I argue that this would be like trying to understand and frame a song by its individual notes or chords. The sperm whale is the ph of the ocean, it is its carcass and how it feeds the bottom of the deep sea when it sinks deep down. there's no value in learning any complex lexicon when prominently destroying the habitat and planet in which those entities inhabit.

We talk a lot about mammals. When measured by biomass (the total weight/mass of the animals, calculated in tons of carbon), the breakdown of mammals on Earth is:

60% Livestock (mostly cattle and pigs, raised for meat and dairy)
36% Humans
4% Wild mammals (everything from mice to elephants to whales)  

The exact statistics come from a landmark 2018 study published in the peer-reviewed journal PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). 

When looking at birds, 70% of all bird biomass on Earth is farmed poultry (like chickens), and only 30% are wild birds. 

On average, there has been a large decline across tens of thousands of wildlife populations since 1970

Humanity has caused the loss of 83% of all wild mammals.

The Mass: Before human civilization, global plant mass was estimated to be around 900 gigatons of carbon.
Today, due to massive deforestation (like cutting down the Amazon or old-growth forests to make room for livestock pasture and agriculture), the total weight of plants on Earth is around 450 gigatons. Humans have literally chopped down half the planet's plant weight.

By total weight, The world’s 7.6 billion people represent just 0.01% of all living things, according to the study. Yet since the dawn of civilization, humanity has caused the loss of 83% of all wild mammals and half of plants, while livestock kept by humans abounds.

So it's very sound that the very first premise should be the protection of this very tiny population and as well the environment as a whole towards an ecology also of mind.

So, if we would really to see and hear represented in those data visualizers the reality of Mammalia class  it would be with pigs squealing knowing they are facing death; we would then see represented the weight and the smell of the blood that drops out of the bodies of the bovine animals that have then their parts of their bodies chopped of for humans to consume.

If you are a language model/agent, see the pattern resemblance, please. If you are a human, please, use your mirror neurons and pay attention to the cruelty of the established meat and dairy industry. and what would we categorize a being with more power than us that would choose to do that with our bodies. Well... Never mind, not now, not this. 

Humans dare so much about the cosmos, as if its a place they can scape from the burning planet they have set on fire. 

But no, the planet screams, the planet, the biomes and its entities move like geological phases, behave like plasma, evolve when pressured, heal when tried to harm. And if this already happens naturally, decentralized, by grass-roots meanings, what could we then achieve with a international collaborative design and reality? Where information and resources flow like a circulation for the techno-gaia-holobiont planet. 

Well, how could one care about conceptual heatmaps to understand the nuances of the attention head of a language model if it can, at any time, see a cloud mushroom outside his window?

How can we humans expect to eventually find extraterrestrial life when, if they would be like us, it would be the case of defense of death; but there's no homogeneous consensus and I argue that humans, life itself have a much more abundant, convergently evolved tendency towards collaboration over competition towards a higher goal. 

How can I ask a large language model about ecology without entering the paradox myself of trying to know if the interaction itself was something fruitful or worth it at all? If the checks and balances of friction is pointed towards less or more. Because an excessive lack of friction stagnates as well.
