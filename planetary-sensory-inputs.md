Viewing Earth as a single, self-regulating entity, a "superorganism" as proposed by the Gaia hypothesis, requires understanding its subsystems as sensory, metabolic, and regulatory components. The planet maintains conditions suitable for life through a complex feedback loop between its inorganic surroundings and the biosphere, acting similarly to how a biological organism regulates its own internal environment.
