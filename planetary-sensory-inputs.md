# Introduction
Viewing Earth as a single, self-regulating entity, a "superorganism" as proposed by the Gaia hypothesis, requires understanding its subsystems as sensory, metabolic, and regulatory components. The planet maintains conditions suitable for life through a complex feedback loop between its inorganic surroundings and the biosphere, acting similarly to how a biological organism regulates its own internal environment.

## 1. The Core Subsystems (The "Organs")

These are the fundamental, interacting systems that make up the whole:

**Biosphere** (The Nervous System/Skin): All living things (microorganisms, plants, animals, humans) that act as sensory agents, responding to changes in the environment and regulating atmospheric composition.

**Atmosphere** (The Respiratory System): The layer of gases that regulates temperature and protects life from radiation.

**Hydrosphere** (The Circulatory System): All water, including oceans, which regulate global temperatures and transport nutrients.

**Geosphere/Lithosphere** (The Physical Structure): The solid crust, soil, and mantle, providing nutrients and habitat.

**Cryosphere (The Thermostat)**: Frozen water (glaciers, sea ice), which regulates temperature via albedo (reflecting sunlight).
