# Introduction
Viewing Earth as a single, self-regulating entity, a "superorganism" as proposed by the Gaia hypothesis, requires understanding its subsystems as sensory, metabolic, and regulatory components. The planet maintains conditions suitable for life through a complex feedback loop between its inorganic surroundings and the biosphere, acting similarly to how a biological organism regulates its own internal environment.

## 1. The Core Subsystems (The "Organs")

These are the fundamental, interacting systems that make up the whole:

**Biosphere** (The Nervous System/Skin): All living things (microorganisms, plants, animals, humans) that act as sensory agents, responding to changes in the environment and regulating atmospheric composition.

**Atmosphere** (The Respiratory System): The layer of gases that regulates temperature and protects life from radiation.

**Hydrosphere** (The Circulatory System): All water, including oceans, which regulate global temperatures and transport nutrients.

**Geosphere/Lithosphere** (The Physical Structure): The solid crust, soil, and mantle, providing nutrients and habitat.

**Cryosphere (The Thermostat)**: Frozen water (glaciers, sea ice), which regulates temperature via albedo (reflecting sunlight).

**Noosphere**: Defined he "sphere of human thought" or "sphere of reason": a conceptual, emerging layer of consciousness, information, and technology that envelops the Earth. 

Coined in the early 20th century by Vladimir Vernadsky and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, it represents the next evolutionary stage following the geosphere (inanimate matter) and biosphere (life); noun: The sum of human knowledge, thought, and culture. https://wordsmith.org/words/noosphere.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere https://www.humanenergy.io/what-is-the-noosphere https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3378 https://www.hst-journal.com/index.php/hst/article/view/520 https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/humaff-2022-1017/html https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04910 https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04910 https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3378 https://www.hst-journal.com/index.php/hst/article/view/520

While usually defined as "the sphere of **human** consciousness and mental activity especially in regard to its influence on the biosphere and in relation to evolution.", Here the concept is presented as a post-anthropocentric framing of it, merged with Gaia Theory, a planetary and systemic, polyphonic version of intelligence, as the sum of the planetary qualia (the sum of the individual qualies of each earthling entity), as called for David Chalmers when talking about a qualia of a subject; or though the lens of its integrated information within that complex system, as described by Tononi.

### 1.1 Geosphere - Expanded

Volcanism is the primary mechanism by which the Geosphere (the physical structure) interacts with the other "organs." It acts as a bridge:The Digestive/Metabolic System: Volcanoes "recycle" materials from the Earth's interior, releasing essential nutrients (like phosphorus) and gases (like $CO_2$) back into the atmosphere and biosphere to sustain life processes.The Pressure Valve: Just as a biological organism must release internal pressure and heat to maintain homeostasis, volcanic eruptions regulate the internal thermal energy of the planet.

The **Endogenous System** is a term used in geology to describe processes originating within the Earth, effectively the "Internal Physiology" of the planet. [5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/social-science/endogenic-processes-class-11-geography-notes/) [6](https://pt.slideshare.net/slideshow/endogenous-processes-on-earth/74876655)

Unlike **Exogenic Processes (Exogenous Systen)** (weathering/erosion) that wear down the surface, endogenic forces build it up.  [7](https://pt.slideshare.net/slideshow/endogenic-processes-the-process-within/63886521) [8](https://pt.slideshare.net/slideshow/endogenous-processes-on-earth/74876655) [9](https://www.pw.live/ssc/exams/endogenic-processes)

#### Key Aspects of the Endogenous System:

Driving Forces: Primarily driven by internal thermal energy, convection currents in the mantle, and gravitational forces.
Primary Processes:

Tectonism (Diastrophism): Large-scale deformation of the crust, including folding (mountain building) and faulting.

Volcanism: The movement of molten rock (magma) from the interior to the surface.

Metamorphism: The alteration of rock structure and mineralogy due to extreme heat and pressure.

Surface Effects: Responsible for major landforms like mountain ranges, oceanic trenches, and volcanic islands.

Global Impact: These processes continuously reshape the planet’s surface, driving the rock cycle and providing the foundational structure that external forces then modify.
